        "###This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has from the data. In this dataset there are 119390 rows and 32 columns in which we have also handled null values.We have performed exploratory data analysis with python to get insight from the data.firstly we have to tackle with dataset like upload & overview the data, understood the domain knowledge regarding dataset then have performed with initialize the process using head method to show first five rows and tail method to show last five rows. dataset information with the help of info. and use shape to find number of rows and columns. we have found the unique values and names of all attributes present in the dataset. that after data wrangling process has took place in which we have found the null values or missing values, duplicate values and have handled by removing it with some major function like dropna.in this dataset about 488 missing values in 'country' , 16340 null values in 'agent' and 112593 in 'company'. there are also duplicate vales in this dataset but have no need to handled it due to domain information of the datset have got affected. Data visualization have also performed accordingly. there are about 15 different charts have plotted having different useful meaning. Charts in which majority of count plot, one heat-map to show correlation between variables, we have checked the  outliers, found outliers in the dataset, apply a special method to remove it and  plotting in both cases even after and before removing outliers. and finally conclusion summary has written in the termination desk.\n"
